This file contains some information on what it is freedesktop and the XDG
families of specifications.

Freedesktop is a project aiming to develop specifications to enable
interoperability between Unix-like operating systems.

Vim tries to conform, for some extent, to the specifications made by
freedesktop (see |xdg-base-dir|).

==============================================================================
XDG Base Directory Specification	*xdg-base-dir* *$XDG_CONFIG_HOME*

The XDG Base Directory Specification aim to define standard locations for the
multilple data e configuration files used by applications. In order to divide
this files by their use and not by application. This is mainly done to go
against the legacy behavior of dumping everything in the home directory.

This directories should be overwritable by the user, using environment
variable but should also give fallback in case those variables weren't set. 

This is a not exhaustive of those directories:
  XDG_CACHE_HOME    HOME/.cache		Ephemiral data files
  XDG_CONFIG_HOME   HOME/.config	Configuration files
  XDG_DATA_HOME	    HOME/.local/share	Persistent data files
  XDG_STATE_HOME    HOME/.local/state	State data files

							*xdg-vimrc*
Vim, on Unix systems, will look at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vim/vimrc` for
configuration (see |vimrc|) but it will source it only if no other rc is found
in  `$HOME` or `$HOME/vim`.

							*xdg-runtime*
When the |xdg-vimrc| is used the |'runtimepath'| will be modified accordingly
to respect the |xdg-base-dir|: >

    "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vim,$VIMRUNTIME,/after,$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vim/after"
