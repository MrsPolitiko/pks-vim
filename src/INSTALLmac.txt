INSTALLmac.txt - Installation of Vim on Mac

This file contains instructions for compiling Vim. If you already have an
executable version of Vim, you don't need this.

1. Prerequisites
================

1. Only macOS is supported. For Classic Mac OS support, use Vim 6.4.

2. Make sure you've installed Xcode or Command Line Tools:

   To install Xcode, get it from the Mac App Store.

   To install Command Line Tools, open Terminal and run:

       xcode-select --install


2. Installation
===============

To install a terminal version of Vim, use the standard Unix routine:

    cd .../src
    make
    sudo make install

To install a GUI version of Vim:

  1. Install XQuartz, which you can download from https://www.xquartz.org/.

  2. Uncomment these lines in the Makefile:

         CONF_OPT_GUI = --enable-gui=athena
         CONF_OPT_DARWIN = --disable-darwin

  3. Use the standard Unix routine (above).


3. Other notes
==============

These Mac-specific configure options are explained in the Makefile:

  --disable-darwin
  --with-mac-arch

Before running the tests, install GNU Libtool with the program prefix "g":

  To do that with Homebrew, run:

      brew install libtool

  To do that from source:

    1. Download the source code from https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/.

    2. Run these commands from the root of the source code directory:

           ./configure --program-prefix=g
           make
           sudo make install

For more details, see src/INSTALL.
