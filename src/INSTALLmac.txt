INSTALLmac.txt - Installation of Vim on Mac

This file contains instructions for compiling Vim. If you already have an
executable version of Vim, you don't need this.

First, install Xcode or Command Line Tools.

  You can download Xcode from the Mac App Store.

  You can install Command Line Tools by opening Terminal and running:

    xcode-select --install

To install a terminal version of Vim, use the standard Unix routine:

  cd .../src
  make
  sudo make install

To install a GUI version of Vim:

  First, install XQuartz, which you can download from xquartz.org.

  Then, uncomment these lines in the Makefile:

    CONF_OPT_GUI = --enable-gui=athena
    CONF_OPT_DARWIN = --disable-darwin

  Finally, use the standard Unix routine (above).

Other notes

  To run the tests, first install GNU Libtool with the program prefix "g".

  These Mac-specific configure options are explained in the Makefile:

    --disable-darwin
    --with-mac-arch

  Only macOS is supported. For Classic Mac OS support, use Vim 6.4.
